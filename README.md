# Redis Product API

This is a backend API built with Node.js, Express, and ioredis. It provides CRUD functionality for managing products, orders, suppliers, stock, and users stored in a Redis database.

## Major Features

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
The API now implements a simple RBAC system to control access to sensitive operations.
- **Roles**: Users can have different roles. By default, a newly registered user is assigned the `user` role. The system is designed to support other roles, such as `admin`.
- **Protected Routes**: Certain actions are restricted to specific roles. For example, deleting products or suppliers is now an **admin-only** action.
- **How it Works**: When a user logs in, their role is embedded in their JWT. A special middleware checks this role on protected routes to grant or deny access.

### Advanced Product Search and Filtering
The `GET /products` endpoint has been significantly upgraded to support efficient searching, sorting, and pagination, making it suitable for large product catalogs. The previous implementation, which used the `KEYS` command, has been replaced with a scalable solution using Redis indexes.
- **Filtering**: Filter products by `category`.
- **Sorting**: Sort products by `price` or `name`.
- **Pagination**: Control the number of results per page using `page` and `limit` parameters.

**Example Query:**
`GET /products?category=Electronics&sortBy=price&sortOrder=desc&page=1&limit=20`
- `category` (string): Filters products by the specified category.
- `sortBy` (string): Sorts results by `price` or `name`.
- `sortOrder` (string): `asc` (default) or `desc`.
- `page` (number): The page number to retrieve (default: `1`).
- `limit` (number): The number of items per page (default: `10`).

### Transactional Order Processing
The order creation process is now fully transactional, guaranteeing data integrity and preventing race conditions.
- **Atomic Operations**: When an order is created, the system checks for product availability and decrements stock in a single, atomic transaction using Redis's `WATCH`/`MULTI`/`EXEC` commands.
- **Conflict Resolution**: If stock levels change while an order is being placed (e.g., due to a concurrent purchase), the transaction will safely fail, and the API will return an error message prompting the user to try again. This prevents overselling and ensures the database remains in a consistent state.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm
- Docker (for running Redis)

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd redis-product-api
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your Redis connection details and a JWT secret.
    ```
    REDIS_HOST=localhost
    REDIS_PORT=6379
    REDIS_PASSWORD=
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key
    ```

4.  **Start Redis using Docker:**
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 6379:6379 --name my-redis redis
    ```

5.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The server will be running on `http://localhost:4000`.

## Authentication

The API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to authenticate requests. To access protected endpoints, you must first register and log in to obtain a token.

### 1. Register a new user

Send a `POST` request to `/auth/register` with the user's name, email, and password.

```json
{
  "name": "Test User",
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

### 2. Login

Send a `POST` request to `/auth/login` with the registered email and password.

```json
{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

The API will return a JWT token.

```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI..."
}
```

### 3. Accessing Protected Routes

To access a protected route, include the token in the `Authorization` header of your request, prefixed with `Bearer `.

```
Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
```

## API Documentation

The API is documented using Swagger. Once the server is running, you can access the Swagger UI at `http://localhost:4000/api-docs`.

You can use the "Authorize" button in the Swagger UI to add your JWT token and test the protected endpoints directly from the documentation.

## File-by-File Description

### Root Directory

- **`.gitignore`**: This file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git. This typically includes build artifacts, log files, and environment-specific files.
- **`package.json`**: This file contains metadata about the Node.js project, such as its name, version, and dependencies. It also defines the scripts that can be run, such as `start` and `test`.
- **`package-lock.json`**: This file is automatically generated for any operations where `npm` modifies either the `node_modules` tree, or `package.json`. It describes the exact tree that was generated, such that subsequent installs are able to generate identical trees, regardless of intermediate dependency updates.
- **`README.md`**: The main documentation file for the project. It provides an overview of the project, instructions on how to set it up and run it, and documentation for the API endpoints.
- **`test-dotenv.js`**: This is a utility file for testing the `dotenv` configuration. It is not part of the main application or the tests.

### `src` Directory

- **`src/app.js`**: This is the main application file. It creates an Express application instance and configures it with the necessary middleware, such as `cors` for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing and `express.json` for parsing JSON request bodies. It also sets up the Swagger UI for API documentation and registers the routes for all the different resources (`products`, `orders`, `suppliers`, `users`, `stock`, `locations`).
- **`src/server.js`**: This is the entry point of the application. It imports the Express app from `app.js`, connects to Redis, and starts the server on the specified port (or 4000 by default). It also includes a function to seed the database with some initial user data if no users exist.

#### `src/config`

- **`src/config/redisClient.js`**: This file is responsible for creating and configuring the Redis client. It reads the Redis connection details (host, port, username, password) from the environment variables and uses them to create a new `ioredis` instance. It also includes event listeners to log when the client is ready to use or when there is a connection error. The configured Redis client is then exported for use in other parts of the application.
- **`src/config/swagger.js`**: This file configures the Swagger documentation for the API. It uses the `swagger-jsdoc` library to generate a Swagger specification based on the JSDoc comments in the route files. It defines the basic information for the API, such as the title, version, and description, and specifies the location of the route files that contain the Swagger annotations. The generated `swaggerSpec` is then exported to be used with `swagger-ui-express` in `src/app.js`.
